🧑‍💻 6.  Linux & Windows Basics 

1.  Easy:  What command would you use in Linux to list files in a directory?
2.  Slightly Harder:  What’s the difference between `chmod 777` and `chmod 755`?
3.  Medium:  How would you find SUID binaries on a Linux system?
4.  Hard:  What is a scheduled task in Windows and how can it be abused for privilege escalation?
5.  Challenging:  Explain how you would escalate privileges on a Linux machine using a misconfigured cron job.

✅ 1. Fundamentals (must be crystal clear)
CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

Difference between:

Vulnerability, Threat, Risk, Exploit

Penetration Testing vs Vulnerability Assessment

Types of hackers: white hat, black hat, gray hat

OWASP Top 10 (just names and simple 1  line examples)

🔎 2. Networking & Web Basics
OSI Model (layers + real  world examples)

TCP vs UDP (ports, handshakes, etc.)

IP addressing, Subnetting basics

Common ports & services (e.g., HTTP 80, HTTPS 443, SSH 22)

DNS and how a domain is resolved

HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

HTTP response codes (200, 301, 403, 404, 500)

🧪 3. Enumeration & Scanning
What is enumeration?

Difference between active and passive reconnaissance

Nmap:

Common scan types (SYN, UDP, Version detection)

Scan examples: nmapsVA target.com

What information can you get from Nmap?

Banner grabbing

🕷 4. Web Vulnerabilities (OWASP Focus)
SQL Injection (how to detect, how to exploit manually)

Command Injection

Cross  Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored)

CSRF (basic understanding)

File upload bypass / Path Traversal

Authentication bypass (logic flaws, default creds)

Broken Access Control (horizontal/vertical privilege escalation)

🧰 5. Tools You May Be Asked About
Burp Suite:

Proxy, Repeater, Intruder

Intercepting traffic

Kali Linux basics

Wireshark (basic packet analysis)

Metasploit:

What it is

When to use it

Example: search exploit, use, set RHOST, exploit

Nikto / Dirb / Gobuster

TryHackMe or Hack The Box (mention rooms you've done)

🔐 6. Linux & Windows Basics
Basic Linux commands (ls, grep, find, chmod, wget, curl)

File permissions

Windows Command Prompt basics (whoami, net user, tasklist)

Common Linux and Windows privilege escalation vectors (kernel exploits, weak service permissions, SUID files)

📄 7. Reporting & Soft Skills
How to write a vulnerability report

What to include in an executive summary

Severity levels (CVSS score basics)

Can you explain a technical concept to a non  technical person?

Times when you showed initiative in learning cybersecurity

👥 8. Behavioral Questions
Why cybersecurity?

What do you know about Devsinc?

Tell me about a time you solved a problem

What was your most interesting HTB or TryHackMe machine/project?

Are you comfortable working in a team, learning from scratch, and documenting findings?

🎯 Bonus (Stand Out)
Knowledge of CTF challenges or real  world Bug Bounty writeups

Familiarity with Git/GitHub
